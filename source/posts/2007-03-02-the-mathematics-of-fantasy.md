I was excited by learning inductive logic for the first time. Given the details of a certain situation, what can be induced to apply to any subsequent instance? While this may pertain to a discrete reality, I've recently come to believe that this process is the core of fantasy, as well.<!--more-->

Briefly stated, fantasy is reality minus details, plus details.
<code> F = (R - d<sub>1</sub>) + d<sub>2</sub></code>

Delving more deeply, there exists a reality. Some may say there <a href="http://www.wisdomsdoor.com/rcbooks/catalog.htm" title="Hermes reprazent!">are many</a>, or that there is one but viewed from <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/h3o/Dislocation/reality.html" title="My second favorite Berger">many angles</a>, all of which I don't care to debate. Whatever it is, it's full of details.

These details often get in the way of our full apprehension of it. <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/" title="ScottMcCloud.com">Scott McCloud</a> makes reference to this in his theory of "<a href="http://www.tcj.com/3_online/e_dean_120499.html" title="The Comics Journal's critique">masking</a>", in which a less-rendered protagonist is more accessible to a reader than a fully-rendered one.

Once the reality has been distilled from its trappings, additional details can be re-introduced safely. In the inarguably well-rendered <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/books/review/Biersdorfer.t.html?ex=1330059600&en=2cfb388cd4455ce1&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss" title="NYTimes review of 'The Physics of the Buffyverse'">Buffyverse</a>, there are specifics to the point of trivia. Still, the writers of the show have stated that the Monster-of-the-Week is merely a metaphor for abstracted human issues. Dealing with stress becomes demonic slave-drivers. Reality is still intact, but wholly transformed into fantasy.

This is no thought exercise. These issues come up on a regular basis for many of us. Granted, I may have first become aware of them in my high school days, where <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/" title="GURPS at SJGames.com">my own hobbies</a> were under constant scrutiny by the hacky-sacking upper crust, despite their established <a href="http://www.theescapist.com/rpgpaper.htm#positive%20effects%20of%20gaming" title="Positive effects of gaming">positive effects</a>... More recently, watching an episode of <a href="http://www.serenitymovie.com/" title="Own it yet?">Firefly</a> with my girlfriend led to questions like, "Why are they speaking in Chinese?" and "Why does that guy have a sword?" which pulled my relationship with fantasy (specifically sci-fi in this case) to the center of my human relationship. I was forced to confront why (or better yet, <em>how</em>) I better relate to Malcolm Reynolds than an office-mate.

The <a href="http://www.foreignoffice.com/projekts/movies/movie_com.htm" title="ForeignOffice.com">details in "Children of Men"</a> are not what made it a great film, but they are what made it fantasy. I've seen plenty of movies about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0085970/" title="Mr. Mom on IMDB">men with kids</a>, but none have so well abstracted the concept of fatherhood. No doubt an excellent script and flawless acting helped create the world, but the <em>world</em> was what made the film reach me and establish a connection between my abstracted model of myself-as-father all the way back to the reality of my being one someday.

Fantasy is the laboratory in which many of us discover reality. It may take a certain kind of mind, but to those people it is invaluable.
