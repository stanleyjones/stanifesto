I cut my finger (the pointing one) at work today and have but nine left with which to type, so I figured I'd keep the cutting going and follow it up with some pasting (that's &#8984;-X followed by &#8984;-V for those playing at home).<!--more-->

What follows, after the necessary introductions, are direct quotes from Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16934083/site/newsweek/" title="'Bill Gates on Vista and Apple' on Newsweek">last week's Newsweek interview</a> and the recently released "<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/" title="'Thoughts on Music' on Apple.com">Thoughts on Music</a>", respectively. I admit a slight bias may have come up during editing.

<b>Steve:</b> Hello, I'm a Mac.

<b>Bill:</b> And I'm a PC.

<b>Steve:</b> There are many smart people in the world, some with a lot of time on their hands.

<b>Bill:</b> I don't think the over 90 percent of the population who use Windows PCs think of themselves as dullards.

<b>Steve:</b> Music purchased from Microsoft’s Zune store will only play on Zune players.

<b>Bill:</b> There's tons of people who help make those decisions, so I wouldn't overstate my role in the past... I don't know why Apple is acting like it’s superior.

<b>Steve:</b> Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats... This is clearly the best alternative for consumers.

<b>Bill:</b> That’s for my customers to decide.

<b>Steve:</b> Any company trying to protect content using a DRM must frequently update it with new and harder to discover secrets.

<b>Bill:</b> It’s totally according to plan, and that’s why we have the whole Windows Update thing.

<b>Steve:</b> Microsoft’s recent decision to switch their emphasis from an “open” model of licensing their DRM to others to a “closed” model of offering&mdash;

<b>Bill:</b> If you just want to say, "Steve Jobs invented the world, and then the rest of us came along," that's fine.

<b>Steve:</b> Apple will embrace this wholeheartedly.
