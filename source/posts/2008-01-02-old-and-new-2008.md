I made you a mixtape for New Years. I hope you like it.<!--more-->

It really is a mixtape, too. It has two sides and each is less than 30 minutes, so you could theoretically copy them onto a cassette... you know, if you had one... uh, and a device you could use to record onto it. Let's be honest, this is going straight into iTunes.

<h4>Side A - Out with the Old <small>(<a href="http://sunshocked.com/stanifesto/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/OldAndNew-SideA.mp3">download</a>)</small></h4>

The first half is a mix of tracks of my own that I happened to have laying around from the last two years or so. Maybe you've heard them, maybe you haven't. Either way, I had to do something with them because I'd like to move past them and they're in the way. Sedate and serene, this mix hovers around 120bpm.

<h4>Side B - In with the New <small>(<a href="http://sunshocked.com/stanifesto/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/OldAndNew-SideB.mp3">download</a>)</small></h4>

Two-thousand eight is already full of hope. The topics range from personal endeavors to national politics to global challenges but, regardless, <em>my</em> hope that the year sounds something like this. Mercilessly bouncy, I have a hard time not dancing to these songs. None of them are mine, but they represent a sound I'm interested in (especially <a href="http://www.rexthedog.net/" title="RexTheDog.net">Rex the Dog</a>, he's so dreamy). Consider it a statement of intention at an effervescent 130bpm.

I've decided against attaching a track listing of the second mix, for fear that roving Googlebots will discover I'm giving away free music and <a href="http://www.riaa.com/reportpiracy.php" title="Please don't turn me in!">notify The Man</a>. Email me if you positively <em>must</em> know a track.

Switching to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/" title="BlueprintCSS at Google Code">Blueprint</a> has left the Stanifesto design with some rough edges... look for that and many more things to be resolved in 2008. Official "Resolutions" to come!
