Since I happen to be a webmaster for one of the <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/org20" title="Smartest Orgs Online at Squidoo">Top 59 Smartest Organizations Online</a>, I often get asked for advice on being a smart webmaster. Here are some of the best and/or easiest to remember.<!--more-->

First, you have to love <a href="http://www.aboyandhiscomputer.com/show.php?ItemID=2204" title="The iProduct">Apple products</a>. They're really pretty on the outside, but they run some sort of Unix type thing on the inside. Just like webmasters. We have to be comfortable using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="Photoshop at Adobe">Photoshop</a> one second and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" title="vi on Wikipedia">vi</a> the next. Of course, if you don't actually use a Mac to do your webmastering, you'll have to balance things out by owning lots of iPods (they come in several "<a href="http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/pokemon/gottacatchemall.htm" title="Pokemon Lyrics">gotta catch'em all</a>" sizes).

Next, you need to be super-organized. Webmastering can be very stressful, what with managing a co-located server running all the very latest versions of lots of Open Source software, editing standards-compliant <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" title="W3 Specs for XHTML 1.0">XHTML Strict</a> files by hand, and manipulating custom graphics pixel by pixel. To handle all of these high-tech tasks, you need a <a href="http://www.moleskines.com/" title="The Official Moleskine Website">Moleskine</a>. That's right. Nothing says "I'm a cutting edge webmaster," like a 200-year old notebook. Feeling a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite" title="Luddite on Wikipedia">Luddite</a>? Balance it out with a <a href="http://www.spacepen.com/Public/Home/index.cfm" title="SpacePen.com">Fisher Space Pen</a> and you'll be right as rain (which, incidentally, you could write during&mdash;the Space Pen can write underwater, upside down, and even in <em>space</em>!).

Finally, you're going to want to <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/shirts/robotjuicecoffee/" title="And buy the t-shirt from DieselSweeties">drink a lot of coffee</a>. This will do two things for you. One, it will give lots of energy to accomplish all of the unreasonable tasks that are constantly asked of you by your tech-ignorant staff. Second, it will make you <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/caffeine2.html" title="Dangers of Caffeine">jittery and paranoid</a> so all tasks asked of you seem unreasonable and that you are vastly more intelligent than everyone else.

I'm sure I have other secrets that make me a smart webmaster. Some may have to do with <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/nov2005/id20051109_002975.htm" title="Morville interviewed by BusinessWeek">findability</a>, <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/progressive-disclosure.html" title="Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox">progressive disclosure</a>, or the application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law" title="Zipf's Law on Wikipedia">Zipf curves</a> to traffic patterns, but they're harder to grasp. Just stick with the basics (above) and you, too, can be a smart webmaster. Oh, and go vote for RAN in the <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/org20" title="The 59 Smartest Orgs Online">Squidoo poll</a>.
