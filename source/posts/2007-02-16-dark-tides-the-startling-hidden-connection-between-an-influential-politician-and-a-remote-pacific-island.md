Al Gore. Affable, amiable, genial... he's charmed America with his 1337 <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2006/05/inconvenienttruth/" title="Uh, Keynote actually.">Powerpoint</a> skills and put us on the right path to addressing the looming menace of climate change. Moral to a fault, no one has ever questioned his motives. Until now.<!--more-->

Sure, there are <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/2/14/154232/368" title="'Gore still not in presidential race' on Grist">claims</a> that his self-aggrandizement (the hubris of suggesting that <a href="http://www.sunshocked.com/stanifesto/archives/survival-bowl/" title="'Survival Bowl' on Stanifesto">climate change is caused by humans</a>!) has all been to bolster his name recognition for a <a href="http://www.draftgore.com/" title="DraftGore.com">presidential bid</a>. However, couldn't he have made an equally interesting movie about the dangers of <a href="http://www.openformats.org/main" title="OpenFormats.org">proprietary data formats</a>? The answer: yes.

For some reason he chose climate change, despite being almost 60 years old&mdash;clearly beyond the reach of the majority of its devastation. He has kids, but their affluence will likely guard them as well. Why care about climate change? What's the dark secret? What's the nefarious, shadowy, wicked, dark, dark secret that has him so concerned about the future of our planet and its people?

Tuvalu.

That's right. I know I probably just blew your mind. You may not even know what Tuvalu is. Follow the money and it becomes much more clear.

<strong>Fact:</strong> At some point during his Congressional service, Al Gore <a href="http://www.perkel.com/politics/gore/internet.htm" title="Inventing the Internet">invents the internet</a>.

<strong>Fact:</strong> After a failed bid for the presidency, Al Gore becomes Chairman of <a href="http://www.current.tv/" title="Current.tv">Current.tv</a>, a progressive television channel/community.

<strong>Fact:</strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" title="Top-level domain on Wikipedia">top-level domain</a> extension .tv is the country code for the <a href="http://www.timelesstuvalu.com/" title="Official Tourism Site">island nation of Tuvalu</a>. Something that only the inventor of the internet (or residents of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/" title="Last.fm">Federation of Micronesia</a>) could possibly know!

<strong>Fact:</strong> Due to climate change leading to rising sea level, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2005/12/tuvalu_that_sin_1.html" title="'That sinking feeling' on PBS.org">Tuvalu is sinking</a>. The entire country will likely disappear entirely if trends are not reversed.

Put the pieces together. Who has the most to gain from Tuvalu not sinking? Al Gore. Who has the most to gain from stopping climate change, thereby saving Tuvalu? Al Gore. Who has put up a <a href="http://www.virginearth.com/" title="Virgin Earth">$25 million bounty</a> to the creator of a machine that sucks Greenhouse Gases out of the atmosphere, thereby slowing climate change without addressing root causes, thereby not necessarily saving Tuvalu? Al Gore.

I rest my case. The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16920923/" title="'Gore nominated for Nobel Peace Prize' on MSNBC">Norwegians</a> must be told.
