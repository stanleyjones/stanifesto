When I lived in Indiana, I dreamt of San Francisco as a Bohemian paradise of art, love, and radical politics. Though my fantasies lacked specifics, I could have easily been thinking of the San Francisco International Film Festival, which begins today.<!--more-->

Last year I managed to make it to three films:

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/whokilledtheelectriccar/" title="Sony's official site">"Who Killed the Electric Car?"</a></dt>
<dd>I describe this movie, whenever I get a chance, as the Schindler's List of Electric Vehicles. To watch the amazing EV1 get shredded to bits because some fat cat is trying to hide that they're better than the stuff GM currently makes is absolutely heart-wrenching. Well, it wrenched my heart at least. Plus, I'm dating one of the supporting actresses.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.americanblackout.com/" title="AmericanBlackout.com">"American Blackout"</a></dt>
<dd>I acknowledge that Cynthia McKinney is a little batty, if not very batty. But the House of Representatives is supposed to represent America and I know plenty of people who share both her politics and her penchant for conspiracy theories. Ignoring her controversial ego, the much stronger part of this film was the rigorous documentation of how systematic the campaign to suppress the black vote has become. The Republicans have quite an impressive playbook for that game.</dd>

<dt>"The DaVinci Code"</dt>
<dd>Okay, so I didn't quite make it to three. Embarrassing, I realize. Given that both of the above films are the kind you can't just walk into a theater in Middle America and watch, it's truly a crime not to take better advantage of this festival.</dd>
</dl>

Keeping with that sentiment, here are the ones I'm planning to catch this year, alphabeticalish:

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=29" title="'The Deal' at SFIFF">"The Deal"</a></dt>
<dd>The writer/director combo of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436697/" title="'The Queen' at IMDB">"The Queen"</a> swings their attention to Prime Minister Tony Blair and shady backroom wheeling and dealing among Labour Party. Intrigue! World politics! British accents!</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=36" title="'Everything's Cool' at SFIFF">"Everything's Cool"</a></dt>
<dd>As I work for an environmental non-profit, this one's hard to miss. Promising to be a vaguely comedic send up of what my girlfriend calls (only quasi-ironically) the "Non-profit/Industrial Complex", the film follows the re-explosion of environmentalism thanks to climate change going mainstream. My only hope is that <a href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/01/13/doe-intro/" title="The 'Death of Environmentalism' round-up on Grist">Nordhaus and Shellenberger</a> aren't framed as the heroes.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=80" title="'Paprika' at SFIFF">"Paprika"</a></dt>
<dd>It's only got one show time, which I'm going to miss, but someone really should see this just to make sure it's as wonderful as it looks. I've been an anime fan for a long time and very pleased that the genre has grown up with me (Thundercats, on the other hand, is completely unwatchable now).</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=90" title="'Reprise' at SFIFF">"Reprise"</a></dt>
<dd>A group of 20-somethings determined to stick together whose careers take them in different directions. Considering that very well describes the last year of my life, I'm treating this one as a documentary&mdash;and praying that it doesn't with the death of the main character or something suitably tragic.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=119" title="'When the Levees Broke' at SFIFF">"When the Levees Broke"</a></dt>
<dd>Spike Lee. Katrina. Documentary. Should be intense.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=9" title="'Aria' at SFIFF">"Aria"</a></dt>
<dd>I have a feeling that this one's going to be very <a href="http://www.critiquemagazine.com/article/windupbird.html" title="Review of 'Wind Up Bird Chronicle'">Murakami-esque</a>. Maybe because it takes place in Hokkaido, a place inextricably linked in my mind with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Sheep-Chase-Novel/dp/037571894X" title="Buy it on Amazon">magical sheep</a> and a seemingly perfect destination for vaguely surreal character-driven drama. Of course, I might be off.</dd></dl>

I'm planning on going fully Ebert (sans the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355049,cst-nws-ebert24.article" title="Ebert on Ebert">missing jaw</a>) this year and posting reviews as I cross the above off my list. You may have to sit tight for a bit though, as I mentioned before, I'll be in Mexico next week.

I really will be in Mexico next week, but if I wasn't, that would be a great way to end every post, eh? "Thanks for reading and, before I forget, I'm going to be in Mexico next week." Kind of like, "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes" title="Princess Bride quotes on IMDB">Most likely kill you in the morning...</a>"
