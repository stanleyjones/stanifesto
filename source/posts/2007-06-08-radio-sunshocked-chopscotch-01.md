How about something a little different? Here's a song I've been writing. I'm sharing it with you now and you can make suggestions on how I should develop it, which I'll do and then share the next version once I've finished it.<!--more-->

What I'm going for... well, I've been listening to a lot of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Apparat" title="Apparat at Last.fm">Apparat</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Squarepusher" title="Squarepusher at Last.fm">Squarepusher</a> lately. But honestly, I'm trying to recover the musicality that my music had back in high school, while holding on to the closer attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre" title="Timbre on Wikipedia">timbre</a> of my later stuff.

Comments like, "Ooh! I like it!" or "Ick. WTF?" are well and good, something like, "I don't like the hi-hats... too synthy." or "The drums get boring after a while." are much more useful. That said, feedback of all sorts is welcome.
