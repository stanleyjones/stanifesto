Criticism of activists tends to fall into one of two categories. First, that they are hypocritical (e.g. driving cars to protest oil). Second, that they are irrelevant (e.g. riding bikes instead of driving cars like the rest of America). So which is it?<!--more-->

No one knows the answer better than organizations that try to navigate the dark and often deadly middle ground between "selling out" and "dropping out". They receive criticism (both sincere and feigned) from concerned parties on either side of them in the activist spectrum.

For a good example one need not look further than Act Now Productions. Founded by environmentalism's <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/01.08.98/sierraclub-9801.html" title="Metroactive on Sierra Club's youngest president"><i>Wunderkind</i></a> turned <a href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/01/13/werbach-reprint/" title="Grist on Environmentalism's autopsy"><i>L'Enfant Terrible</i></a>, Adam Werbach, Act Now has come under... let's just say "scrutiny" for working with everyone's favorite discount superstore, Wal-Mart. Since the partnership began, talk of Act Now is met with (depending on company) eye-rolling distaste or backhanded compliments. As to whether they were hypocrites or irrelevant, I've always wondered.

<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/118/working-with-the-enemy.html" title="'Working with the Enemy'">An article in this month's Fast Company</a> tried to set the record straight. They acknowledge that Act Now has its critics, from smaller radical organizations to Werbach's previous employer Sierra Club, but mostly stick to puff piece territory, covering the controversy of working with Wal-Mart in far greater detail than the work itself. It ends with the uplifting quote from Werbach on his ability to change a trans-national corporation, "I'm going to try. I'm trying."

Much more troubling is the single line slipped in slyly, "Wal-Mart would not allow Fast Company to interview employees". I was not the only one to notice it, as San Francisco alternative weekly paper SF Weekly <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-09-19/news/wal-mart-r-us/" title="'Wal-Mart R Us'">ran an article</a> the following week tearing apart the Fast Company piece.

<blockquote>[A]fter reading the Fast Company piece, and doing a little more reading and talking to people, I'm afraid Werbach's detractors are right. His current role as Wal-Mart's greenwasher-in-residence is almost certainly doing more harm than good.</blockquote>

SF Weekly author Matt Smith calls up Wal-Mart employees and asks them about the measures mentioned in the Fast Company piece. Not many have even heard of any, those that have say they're being perverted by middle management into ways to make employees' lives harder. The goal of greening Wal-Mart is being translated into moralistic, high ground arguments on why associates need to lose weight or stop smoking.

Upset with the pictured painted by the extremes of the two articles, and the vast room in between, I gave up and went to go talk with some folks from Act Now. They were hosting Sze Ping from <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/china/en/" title="Greenpeace.org/China">Greenpeace China</a> and it was a great opportunity to call them out on the two articles and get at the truth.

Everyone I talked to had read both and were eager to share their perspective. For the most part, they thought both were crap (my paraphrasing, they were very polite). They acknowledged that the Fast Company piece was fluffy, saying that it skipped both the really good and the really bad things that Wal-Mart is doing. "They have to be diplomatic," someone offered. Similarly, the SF Weekly article garnered sighs. "We only started the program in April and Wal-Mart has over a million employees, I'm sure it's not hard to find some who haven't heard of it." Even so, they're thankful that someone's keeping an eye on them. "It's understandable. It's about accountability."

Sze Ping shared some of the clever ways that Greenpeace China gets around the rigid state censorship. "We can't praise, but we can't criticize. And we certainly can't stay silent." Instead, they've partnered with Coca-cola to co-brand energy-efficient technology throughout the upcoming 2008 Olympics in Beijing. In the U.S., this would be a sin, the ultimate sell-out. In China energy-efficiency is a more radical path to sustainability than dropping a banner in Tiananmen Square. "But you would get a free plane ticket to somewhere," Ping laughs.

Ultimately, Act Now agrees that Wal-Mart, like China, is dark territory. It embodies the difficult decisions that activists have to make. Just as we can't solve climate change without addressing the industrial explosion in China, we can't transform corporate America without someone working on Wal-Mart. Both involve rolling up some sleeves and getting dirty, compromising ideology for progress. Hypocrisy and irrelevance both become tools in the social change toolkit to find the position in the spectrum where your pressure has an effect on more than your own ego.
