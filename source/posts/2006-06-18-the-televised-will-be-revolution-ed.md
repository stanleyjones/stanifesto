Or something like that. I speak of <a href="http://vloggercon.com/" title="Vloggercon.com">Vloggercon</a>, which went down only a few blocks from my house last weekend. I felt a little sorry for those that flew in from Amsterdam or wherever, but it's their fault for not living in San Francisco.<!--more-->

While I didn't actually <em>attend</em> Vloggercon itself, I did manage to make it to a number of after-parties, which we all know is where the serious education happens. The first night, I caught up with <a href="http://joshwolf.net/blog/" title="JoshWolf.net">Josh Wolf</a>, whom I first met looking for an apartment in SF. His roommate said I was "ungrounded" and couldn't move in. A few years later, it seems Josh is <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/16/BAGV9JFC6I1.DTL&hw=josh+wolf&sn=001&sc=1000" title="SF Chronicle article">under subpoena</a> by the Federal Grand Jury for not surrendering his footage of a protest to the FBI. Before I left he said, "hey we should hang out again sometime&mdash;and before Thursday, since I might be going to jail." Now who's ungrounded?

A tech convention is incomplete without a visit to fave techie hangout <a href="http://houseofshields.com" title="HouseOfShields.com">House of Shields</a>. I spent most of the evening chatting with <a href="http://www.stylegoddess.com/" title="StyleGoddess.com">Style Goddess</a> Erica Falke. She mentioned that there's an incredible feeling of camaraderie and revolution at tech conferences lately, and I totally agreed. The spirit at <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/" title="SXSW.com">SXSWi 2006</a> was downright Das Kapital-esque. Talk of business strategies and "monetizing" were almost laughed out of the room, in favor of supporting the emerging global democracy and tearing down techno-hierarchies. It tasted like <a href="http://cluetrain.com/" title="The Cluetrain Manifesto">one</a> <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WARHAC.html" title="The Hacker Manifesto">big</a> <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm" title="The Communist Manifesto">manifesto</a> smoothie. And I do so like manifestos.

In short, I now have high expectations of these citizen journalists. The Fourth Estate is sleeping on the job and long in need of "the kicking in of a rotten door", to borrow a quote from the late, great John Kenneth Galbraith. Go get 'em vloggers.
