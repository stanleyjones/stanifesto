Admit it. You secretly hate MySpace. Maybe not even secretly, maybe you <a href="http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&#038;productID=599" title="'Tom is NOT my friend' on Jinx.com">wear the shirt</a> everywhere. Still, you've been forced to respect it because it's an unstoppable juggernaut with over one hundred million members. Well, let's burst some bubbles.<!--more-->

Here they are, ten reasons that MySpace is not all its cracked up to be:
<ol>
<li><strong>MySpace doesn't actually have over one hundred million members.</strong> Given that there are <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060824/BIZ04/608240341/1033/ENT01" 'Site roots out MySpace celebs' in Detroit News">12 Paris Hiltons</a>, and I get tantalizing friend invites from <a href="http://www.burntpickle.com/articles/fake-myspace-profiles/" title="'Fake MySpace Profiles' on BurntPickle">fake profiles</a> all the time, it's reasonable to assume that some percentage of the 100,000,000 are not actually "real people" by any sort of rational measurement.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace's traffic is inflated by bad design.</strong> This summer, onlookers watched in horror as <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/12/tech/main1797109.shtml" title="'MySpace Pulls Ahead in Page View Race' on CBS News">MySpace pushed past Yahoo</a> in page views. But many contend that MySpace's poor interface <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/myspace-click-factory" title="'MySpace: Unstoppable Force or Unnecessary Click Factory?' on Mike Davidson's blog">artificially inflates their page views</a>. With good design, it's suggested that MySpace's traffic would drop to a third to an eighth of current levels.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace is clogging the tubes.</strong> A typical user profile can <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/wso.php" title="Tom's profile run through the Website Optimizer">easily be over 200k</a> with all the unnecessary markup, banner ads, and poorly optimized JavaScript&mdash;and let's not forget the pictures, animations, and videos your "friends" leave in the comments section. That bandwidth has to come from somewhere and ISPs charge for it in <a href="http://www.servicelevel.net/rating_matters/newsletters/issue13.htm" title="ISP bandwidth explanation">spectacularly hard-to-understand ways</a>.</li>

<li><strong><b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">MySpace</b> is not a team player.</strong> They've recently made the decision to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/20/myspace-security-measure-disables-viral-spread-of-widgets/" title="MySpace security measure disables viral spread of widgets' on TechCrunch">handicap YouTube videos</a> by disallowing external links from Flash widgets. Their rationale is bursting with hubris:
<blockquote><p>If you look at virtually any Web 2.0 application, whether its YouTube, whether it’s Flickr, whether it’s Photobucket or any of the next-generation Web applications, almost all of them are really driven off the back of MySpace.<br />&mdash;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/12/myspace-we-dont-need-web-20/" title="quoted from a TechCrunch article">Peter Chernin</a>, NewsCorp COO</p></blockquote>
Sure, Web 2.0 is based on MySpace; If I recall, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp" title="Gore inventing the internet on Snopes">Al Gore was the project lead</a>.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace is being used to spy on you.</strong> More than secret crushes and scorned ex-lovers are reading your profile trying to peer into your life. The NSA, perpetually in trouble for illegal wiretaps and the like, also <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025556.200?DCMP=NLC" title="'Pentagon sets its sights on social networking sites' on New Scientist">monitors social networking sites</a> in order to "connect the dots" between you and criminal activities. Blog about your friend that runs a pirate radio and you could find yourself subjected to some additional security checks the next time you fly.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace is just a fad.</strong> Yes, we <em>all</em> have a crush on <a href="http://www.danah.org/" title="Danah.org">Danah Boyd</a>, who has so deftly defended MySpace on <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17266&#038;ch=infotech" title="in Technology Review">many</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70287-0.html?tw=rss.index" title="in Wired">an</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12335363/site/newsweek/" title="in Newsweek">occasion</a>. Still, while the necessity of youth having a space for congregation will never diminish (anyone remember arcades?), even she admits that it <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html" title="'Friendster lost Stream. Is MySpace just a fad?' on Danah.org">need not always be MySpace</a>. There's no shame in going out looking for that next big thing already, especially if MySpace doesn't work for you.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace contributes to infoglut</strong> (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload" title="'information overload' on Wikipedia">information overload</a>). We humans are generating a <a href="http://www.dclab.com/InfoOverflow.asp" title="Exabytes?">ridiculous amount of electronic information</a>. Do you really need an email telling you that someone has sent you an email?</li>

<li><strong>MySpace is a failure of humanity.</strong> The science seems <a href="http://moneydick.com/wordpress/2006/04/23/science-of-myspace/" title="'The Science of MySpace' on MoneyDick">pretty sound</a>; it has numbers and everything.</li>

<li><strong>MySpace is ruining tomorrow's web designers.</strong> It seems like knowing anything about <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS </acronym> is actually an obstacle to customizing your page in any way. All the <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts" title="'Hacking MySpace layouts' on Mike Davidson's blog">hacks necessary to make simple changes</a> are polluting kids brains with non-semantic, table-based web design. It took ten years to get out off those dark ages, what happens when these kids start getting jobs? Remember when all the kids who used to play with JavaScript to make their backgrounds change colors got jobs and invented <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX?</acronym></li>

<li><strong>Finally, my best friends aren't even on MySpace.</strong> Seriously, I have to, like, call them. So annoying.</li>
</ol>
