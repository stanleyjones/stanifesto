Near the end of <a href="http://www.epicmoviethemovie.com/" title="EpicMovieTheMovie.com">the trailer for "Epic Movie"</a>, opening soon, someone (who is not <a href="http://www.hfpa.org/videogallery/video/49514/" title="SBC interviewed after Golden Globes">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>) dressed in Borat's green super-thong looks at the camera and says, "Niiice." What he means by this is, in fact, "This movie is a new milestone in anti-artistic, self-referential garbage."<!--more-->

It's possible, but not probable, that's I'm just an out-of-touch curmudgeon completely unable to see any value in what "The Kids" are into these days. I don't believe this to be the case, however, as I just watched an episode of MTV's "<a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/the_hills/series.jhtml" title="TheHills.MTV.com">The Hills</a>" and, while it's loathsome content left me pining for the days that MTV played videos (who didn't see <em>that</em> criticism coming?), I still found it's concept compelling. Documenting the dangerously petty lifestyles of Hollywood socialites is something I'm not sure even <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/crochunter/crochunter.html" title="It sucks having to use the past tense here...">Steve Irwin</a> would've been able to handle.

No, "Epic Movie" is wrong, wrong, wrong for a different reason. Watching a movie that makes a mockery of other movies, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417148/" title="SoaP on IMDB">Snakes on a Plane</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457510/" title="Nacho Libre on IMDB">Nacho Libre</a>, or even <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/" title="X-3 on IMDB">X-Men: The Last Stand</a> presupposes that the source material was <em>not</em> a mockery, something which cannot be said for any of those movies. In fact, seeing posters up around town of Pirate Captain Jack Swallows [sic] running from cannibals only suggests to me, "Look! We cannibalized a bunch of movies!" Do they think they're being clever by making a funny movie by taking scenes from other funny movies? Like someone will think, "What a great idea! Just take other peoples' great ideas!"

You can't spoof a spoof. You <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244882,00.html" title="Colbert on OReilly">look stupid</a> trying.

That won't keep people from going to see it, and even laughing at some parts, but I meant what I said about it being a milestone. Movies cost money and Hollywood has long since stopped being anything other than a business, if it ever were. The concept of "franchises" is <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/" title="Harry Potter at Scholastic">not unique</a> to the silver screen, though they perhaps <a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/" title="Harry Potter on Warner Bros">exploit</a> them most overtly. Wade through all the marketing and the thinking comes down to this, "Why take a chance on a movie people have never seen before?" It seems that "Epic Movie" has decided to take that question (which already turns my stomach) quite literally.

"Epic Movie" is a symptom of a much larger problem, like <a href="http://www.getitstraightby2008.org/" title="Voting fraud, for one">many things that suck</a> are. Our mental space, just like our physical, is being knowingly polluted, for profit. It's easy to see when raw sewage is being dumped in your backyard. It's not as easy when the same waste is being dumped straight into your conscious or sub-conscious mind. I'm not willing to commit one way or another on whether projects like "Epic Movie" are <a href="http://www.sedhe.net/dystopia/language.php" title="1984 and the Language of Oppression">systematic efforts</a> to reduce the range of thought of which we're capable, but some sort of <a href="http://www.rachel.org/bulletin/index.cfm?issue_ID=2489" title="Decolonizing the Revolutionary Imagination">decolonization</a> needs to happen internally&mdash;and hopefully then spread to our theaters.

Seriously, this thing looks like an SNL episode.
