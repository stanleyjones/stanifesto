Metaphors allow us to give meaning to the ever increasing amounts of information in our lives while maintaining sanity and&mdash;hopefully&mdash;dignity. But what happens when our metaphors are wrong?<!--more-->

Here are a few metaphors that I hear thrown around in activist circles that, as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes" title="Princess Bride quotes">Inigo Montoya</a> might say, "do not mean what we think they mean."

<h4>Low-hanging fruit</h4>

The first is not unique to activism, business uses it left and right as well. In case you happen to have never been in a meeting when someone uses it, the phrase "low-hanging fruit" is meant to convey benefits that can be attained with minimal action. So, if I want to get 500 signatures to put in a bike lane, the low-hanging fruit might be bike messengers. I could probably quickly acquire a few hundred signatures with not a whole lot of effort.

The problem is, that's <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/11/cdu.html" title="FastCompany.com">not how you pick fruit</a>. Fruit is normally picked starting with the "high-hangers" for two important reasons. First, pickers start at the top and fill their basket as they go down, otherwise they'd be climbing with ever-heavier loads. Second, the fruit lower on the tree is partially shaded by the higher branches and often last to ripen.

So, for the bike lane example, the "low-hanging fruit" would be folks whose names would make it more difficult to get others to sign and who probably aren't high value names to begin with. Elementary school kids, maybe.

<h4>Silver bullets</h4>

Silver bullets often come up when we're looking for a simple solution to a complex problem. An example might be installing solar panels in remote African villages. This fairly simple solution manages to address issues ranging from social (providing power without making the community reliant on fuel) to environmental (cleaner than coal or nuclear) to political (no foreign-owned powerplants requiring a government-owned grid).

However, the term comes to us from <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sil1.htm" "WorldwideWords.com">old European legends</a> about werewolves. Werewolves, immune to normal bullets, can only be killed by silver ones. Far from being simple solutions, silver bullets are actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet" title="Silver bullet on Wikipedia">more difficult to make</a> than regular ones and substantially less bang-for-the-buck, as silver is both softer and more expensive than lead. In short, you'd probably want to avoid using a silver bullet unless you're facing something like a werewolf that can't be defeated through conventional means (which addressing energy needs in developing nations just may be).

<h4>Radical</h4>

Perhaps the most understood metaphor, yet one that activists employ to the point of self-identity, is the notion of "radicalism". Literally "radical" <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/radical" title="radical on Merriam-Webster.com">refers to the root</a> of something, most often a plant. Activists who identify as "radical" maintain that they are getting to the <em>root</em> of the problem&mdash;with the implicit or explicit suggestion that all other strategies will fail to produce true change. Accusations of not being radical enough equate to not being serious about one's beliefs.

Again, reality begs to differ.

Instructions for <a href="http://www.treehelp.com/howto/howto-remove-a-tree-3.asp" title="TreeHelp.com">removing an unwanted tree</a> all begin with cutting the tree down first. Once you've removed a tree's leaves and its ability to photosynthesize its food, it's much easier to deal with the leftover roots. The stump can continue to generate new growth, but diligence will ensure that it never amounts to a new tree, leaving the stump to eventually die. Removing stumps is so difficult that the most common methods include <a href="http://landscaping.about.com/cs/lazylandscaping/ht/stump_removal.htm" title="Stump Removal at About.com">drilling poison-filled holes</a> and <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070419194429AAyz1SA" title="Yahoo Answers on the subject">setting them on fire</a>.

Knowing the truth behind this metaphor encourages a remarkably different angle for activism than "radical", namely removing the ability of destructive systems to feed and perpetuate themselves before attempting to address the "root" of the problem. Maybe everyone working on corporate power should switch to campaigning against advertising. Afterall, it would be difficult for companies to lobby Washington if no one bought their products.
