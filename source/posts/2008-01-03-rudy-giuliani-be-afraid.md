Have you seen Giuliani's latest television spot? It's <em>almost</em> a commercial for an upcoming action movie in the Middle-East, but it teeters precariously on the edge. So I gave it a push.<!--more-->

Okay, first you need to watch the original. This is a real ad from a real politician who is really running for president of our country. No doctoring, no mashing-of-up, nothing like that. People made this <i>sans</i> irony.

Now you can skim through "Planet of the Arabs" which made it to the top of Digg <a href="http://digg.com/movies/Planet_of_the_Arabs_How_Hollywood_Sees_the_Middle_East_2" title="Submission and comments">three days ago</a>. It's a compilation of Hollywood movies featuring vicious stereotypes of Middle-Easterners.

The two were clearly made for one another, so I got them drunk and they got busy.

Note some important improvements to the original advertisement:
<ol>
<li>I removed the video footage of Benazir Bhutto. Some might consider it risky, since she was only tragically murdered a week ago, and might turn out to have been a "bad guy" after all. Oh, and Rudy himself <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/01/02/politics/fromtheroad/entry3668554.shtml" title="CBSNews.com">was quoted saying</a>, "I think it's inappropriate to see [her death] in political terms." So out it comes.</li>
<li>Also, if you're kicking Arab butt, you need an action movie star. Inevitably, there will be a movie someday about September 11<super>th</super> starring Rudy Giuliani, focusing on he bravely prevented one of the greatest tragedies in our nation's history. But until that day, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjYv2YW6azE" title="HuckChuckFacts">Chuck Norris is the go-to guy.</a></li>
<li>Oh, and the end title needed to be in Trajan. <a href="http://www.goodiebag.tv/episodes/06_trajan_is_the_movie_font.htm" title="GoodieBag.tv">Everybody knows that.</a> Der.</li>
</ol>

Just on the off chance that Rudy happens to win the Republican nomination and subsequently the presidency, I've taken the liberty of already starting a "<a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/pre-emptively-impeach-rudy-giuliani" title="Yes, seriously.">Pre-emptively impeach Rudy Giuliani!</a>" petition over at Care2. Feel free to go ahead and make some protest signs, too. Oh, and somebody should tell CodePink.
