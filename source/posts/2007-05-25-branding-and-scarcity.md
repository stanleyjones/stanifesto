When I first got into branding, I was surprised to learn that there were many, many steps before designing a cool logo necessary for creating a successful brand. The first of which must solve the age old problem of scarcity of resources.<!--more-->

My step-father is a business professor at <a href="http://www.mgmt.purdue.edu/" title="Krannert">Krannert School of Management</a> and recommended I check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-6925224-2508815?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=David%20A.%20Aaker" title="David Aaker on Amazon">David Aaker</a>, whom I guess is considered a bit of an authority on the subject. Aaker stresses <em>relevance</em> as an element of branding that a lot of people forget.

Relevance occupies the space between someone knowing who you are and someone liking what you do. Say I'm hungry for a salad. There are thousands of places I could go to get one (including produce stores to make my own). Even though I'm familiar with McDonald's, it's not going to pop into my brain as a destination. I don't connect "salad" and "McDonald's", even though I might connect "food" with "McDonald's". It's not relevant to the current question. Similarly, while I might consider Black &amp; Decker relevant if I were looking for a <a href="http://www.blackanddecker.com/ProductGuide/CategoryOverview.aspx?cPath=1498.1668" title="Hedgetrimmer at BlackAndDecker.com">hedge trimmer</a> or <a href="http://www.blackanddecker.com/ProductGuide/CategoryOverview.aspx?cPath=1496.1501" title="Cordless drills at BlackAndDecker.com">cordless drill</a>, I wouldn't if it were a <a href="http://www.blackanddeckerappliances.com/product-138.html" title="Rice cooker and BlackAndDecker.com">rice cooker</a> I was after.

In this way, branding closely mimics findability on the web. <a href="http://findability.org/" title="Findability.org">Findability</a> is the conceptual sequel to information architecture that stresses the process of users finding your information over the internal structure of the information itself. Do I care if your product is considered top of the line if I never click to the page that describes it?

The folks over at Xerox PARC (who have previously brought you the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto" title="Alto on Wikipedia">mouse, desktop icon, etc.</a>) have put together a model of human behavior while looking for data that they call "Scent Navigation Information Foraging", abbreviated both appropriately and hilariously as <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pirolli03snifact.html" title="What is this CiteSeer site? It looks awesome!">SNIF</a>. SNIF suggests that people <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030630.html" title="Nielson to the rescue">roam the web like hungry beasts</a> in search of information. When we catch a scent, we bound off in that direction (by clicking a link) and smell the air again (by scanning the page). For instance, if I were looking for a job from <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/" title="Yay, missiles!">Lockheed Martin</a>, I wouldn't expect to find a job description on their (awful) homepage, but I would scan for any trigger words that might help me get closer like "careers", "jobs", "opportunities" or failing those "about us" or "corporate". Finding one, I'd pounce and then see if I could get closer from the next page, until I had the poor data-gazelle in my gnashing teeth.

With farms and factories producing far more than we could ever want, the problem of scarcity has been for the most part solved on a physical plane (though problems of sustainable production and equitable distribution of resources remain). Still, demand for branding remains high due to the "supply" of relevance being finite. We simply cannot hold information about the offerings of every single company in our heads. Our collective psyches are slashed and burned for profit, with very little regard for what we ourselves may or may not want to store in there. Cynicism, sarcasm, and an <a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3616001" title="Banner ad blindness">increased resistance to advertising</a> is the end result.

A healthier and more sustainable strategy for branding may be to further pursue the foraging model in greater depth. Advertising would be limited to those seeking advertising, and specifically seeking the products being advertised. This simple evolution&mdash;contextual branding&mdash;is not only respectful, but how Google makes <a href="https://adwords.google.com/" title="Adwords, duh!">billions of dollars a year</a>. Like other landscapes allowed to recover after intense resource extraction, perhaps our minds will eventually return to a more peaceful state.
