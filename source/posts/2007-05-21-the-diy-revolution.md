Somewhere between reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Dissent-Socially-Politically-Graphics/dp/1592531172" title="Buy it on Amazon">Design of Dissent</a>" and trying not to vomit over <a href="http://targetgreen.prweekblogs.com/" title="Target Green blog at PR Week">Target Green</a>, I wondered, "In this age of cynicism and corporate co-option, is there anything capable of authentic revolution?" The answer may surprise you!<!--more-->

Saturday was the Second Annual <a href="http://makerfaire.com/" title="Maker Faire Blog">Maker Faire</a>, where people show off stuff they've made themselves. Yes, themselves. Everything from wallets made from recycled bike tubes to fire engines that spit flames instead of water, these are people who have an obviously different relationship with their "stuff" than a lot of us. How much of what we own is completely pre-fabricated (probably by sweatshop workers who are shocked that we want <a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10251_10201_327372_-1_12589_12551" title="I fucking hate Hollister">holes in our brand new jeans</a>)? How many of us smile with satisfaction at merely putting something together from Ikea, according to their instructions? Maker Faire people eat people like us for breakfast.

Despite my girlfriend's frustration that countless hours manufacturing a <a href="http://tribes.tribe.net/neverwas" title="Neverwas Haul">steam-powered car</a> could maybe be better spent, I believe there is something inherently political about creating something that no one else in the world but you thinks is a good idea. At a minimum, it's mechanical expressionism. Optimally, it's providing the <a href="http://www.sunshocked.com/stanifesto/archives/is-noise-necessary/" title="'Is noise necessary?' on Stanifesto">necessary noise</a> that culture needs to evolve.

The very next day was an exercise in noise if ever there was one. San Francisco's <a href="http://www.ingbaytobreakers.com/main.html" title="Bay to Breakers.com">Bay to Breakers</a> 12k run. Of course, this being San Francisco, people do a lot more than just run. They dress up in ridiculous costumes (or go nekkid) get exceedingly intoxicated (sometimes even running behind a shopping cart with a keg in it) and <em>then</em> run. I've been a participant before (and finished in the Top 10%) but was only a spectator this year.

Bay to Breakers was almost as inspiring from a DIY standpoint as Maker Faire. The costumes range from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmoorr/507038642/" title="Drivers Licenses on Flickr">low-tech but creative</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69605897@N00/508454806/" title="Stormtroopers on Flickr">painstakingly accurate</a>. What surprised me the most was how many groups dressed in what they had to assume were extremely innovative ways, only to find that a <em>lot</em> of others dressed the same. There were more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tavallai/508311982/" title="Bull Runners on Flickr">bull-runners</a> than you could keep track of, multiple <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58077216@N00/507285832/" title="Double Dare on Flickr">Double Dare</a> teams, and scores of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagalloway/508439255/" title="Spartans on Flickr">Spartans</a> (my favorites were the flamingly gay Asian Spartans, for which I cannot find a picture).

The weekend left my girlfriend and I very excited to leave the sidelines and get into the DIY game. After listing all of the projects that we might be interested in pursuing, I compiled them all into one mega-project just for fun. Don't be surprised if you get invited to our fancy DIY dinner party, featuring <a href="http://www.copper-alembic.com/shop/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=149" title="Maybe using this?">homebrewed liquor</a> from our <a href="http://www.hydroponicsonline.com/11plan01.htm" title="Using this thing">hydroponic grapes</a> complete with <a href="http://www.oneart.com/cgi-bin/briarpress/show.cgi?db=press&uid=default&display=1&file=types-lever" title="I want one of these sooo bad">hand-pressed labels</a> printed on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bzedan/sets/967347/" title="With these instructions">recycled paper</a>&mdash;oh, and make sure to sew your <a href="http://oldpatterns.blogspot.com/" title="40s era, anyone?">own formalwear</a> to match the <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/slipcovers101" title="Probably just her on this one">slipcovers</a> in our <a href="http://www.off-grid.net/index.php?p=487" title="My next purchase">solar-powered</a> mock pre-fab <a href="http://readymademag.com/feature_10_shack.php" title="My new house">backyard chateau</a>.
