It would be a great story if Senator Rick Santorum took his family to see <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/" title="ClimateCrisis.net">An Inconvenient Truth</a> and left the theater realizing that his Grand Old Party was defecating all over the world he was planning on leaving to his children, invoking in him a profound shift of character which culminated in his full endorsement of the local Green Party. The truth is profoundly shiftier.<!--more-->

The online news source <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001256.php" title="'GOP Donors Funded Entire Green Party Drive' on TPMmuckraker">TPMmuckraker</a> (the TPM, in this case, standing for <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/" title="Talking Points Memo">Talking Points Memo</a>) reported this afternoon:
<blockquote>Every single contributor to the Pennsylvania Green Party Senate candidate is actually a conservative&mdash;except for the candidate himself.</blockquote>
Yeah, really. The Republicans are funding efforts to get the Green Party on the ballot in order to split the votes for the Democrats. Brilliant! They must have some pretty creative, outside-the-box thinkers on that campaign. Some of them may even use Macs! The whole list is available at <a href="http://www.attytood.com/archives/003603.html" title="'Santorum, the Green Party, and some very strange bedfellows' on Attytood">Attytood</a>.

Why the sudden change of heart? It may have something to do with Santorum getting a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/15045860.htm" title="'Santorum struggles' on San Jose Mercury News">tighter race than he bargained for</a> from his Democratic opponent, Robert Casey. In these days of gerry-mandered districts and bought elections, it's nice to see incumbants with a healthy dose of "Fear of the People".

Other extreme tactics he's employing? How about facing off against Tubemeister Senator Ted Stevens in <a href="http://www.njtelecomupdate.com/lenya/telco/live/tb-SOXO1154546927002.html" title="'Senators Locked In Tight Races Worried About Network Neutrality' on National Journal">trying to prevent</a> the Network Neutrality bill from ever making it to the Senate floor (knowing he'd get hammered for voting against <em>The Internet</em>)? Or maybe labeling his opponent as a terrorist-lover by saying Casey took money from Al-Jazeera. Except that it was a <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/counties/chester_county/15160670.htm" title="'Santorum links Casey to wrong al-Jazeerah' in the Philadelphia Inquirer">different Al-Jazeerah</a>. Oops.
