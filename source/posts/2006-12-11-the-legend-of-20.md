There needs to be a better word to describe companies that embrace community, clarity, and agility as a business model. Though they have nothing to do with Ruby on Rails, AJAX, or tag clouds, there's something decidedly "Web 2.0" about Nintendo lately.<!--more-->

For most, "Web 2.0" is either a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/what_web_20_means_to_500_random_basecamp_customers.php" title="'What Web 2.0 means to 500 random Basecamp customers' on 37signals">meaningless phrase</a> or one <em>way</em> past its expiration date. Yet there is undeniably a meme-complex that the phrase captures.

Now I must digress to explain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics' title="Memetics on Wikipedia">meme-complexes</a>. What defines a bird? All birds fly, but not penguins or ostriches. All birds lay eggs, but so do reptiles and the duck-billed platypus. Still, one can look at a bird and see the loose connection of almost-but-not-quite signifiers and get a good idea for what a "bird" is. We call that little cloud of memes a meme-complex or, just to be clever, memeplex.

To return to the issue at hand, with "Web 2.0" one can see the rounded corners, the subtle gradients, the extra-legible typography and get a good idea for what it looks like (and all of these design elements are present with the friendly-looking Wii). But, of course, there's more to "Web 2.0" than just how it looks.

Of course, others have <a href="http://web2.0validator.com/" title="Web2.0Validator">other criteria</a>. In general, most would agree that it's about treasuring the needs and power of the user over superfluous features.

James Surowiecki (of <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/" title="Wisdom of Crowds on Randomhouse">Wisdom of Crowds</a> fame), acknowledges that Nintendo is <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061204ta_talk_surowiecki" title="'In Praise of Third Place' on NewYorker.com">thriving in 3rd place</a> and cites reasons like recognizing limitations and focusing on making fun games instead of the <strong>bigger!faster!more!</strong> that has seduced Sony and Microsoft (both their consoles and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx" title="Windows Vista">other offerings</a>). My first reaction was, "oh, it looks like Nintendo has read <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/" title="Getting Real on 37signals">Getting Real</a>". While Sony loses money on every PS3, in an effort to capture market share (how Web 1.0!), Nintendo's making money making games people want to play.

Nintendo is far from a cute, little startup. Certainly. I remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxrecy__XQ" title="ROB the Robot on YouTube">gyroscope-spinning robot</a> from the 80s. Still, the spirit of forsaking bloat and simply delivering the goods is delightfully illustrated in both <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2nEHqGWsYM" title="The Wii Commercial collection on YouTube">their own commercials</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXm5n2n_U3c" title="PS3 vs. Wii Commercial on YouTube">parody ads</a>. Contrast this with the sterile padded cell and black monolith in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qamwVJaYW8" title="a PS3 ad on YouTube">Sony ads</a> and it's suddenly easy to imagine Nintendo as a ragtag bunch of passionate coders that slapped this thing together in their spare time and next thing you know it's selling like hotcakes.

There's a lot more that Nintendo could do if they wanted to truly embrace their 2.0 nature. I'd start with making the Virtual Console handle both downloads <em>and uploads</em>, so amateur gamers could share their own creations (which would require Nintendo releasing at least a junior version of its <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym>). Next, take all of the "Abandonware" that is <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162308.html" title="'Abandonware now legal?' on GameSpot">now legal to pirate</a> and Open Source it. Let the community add new levels to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble" title="Bubble Bobble on Wikipedia">Bubble Bobble</a> or new units to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_Zwei" title="Herzog Zwei on Wikipedia">Herzog Zwei</a>. Finally, why not embrace the social networking aspects of 2.0 and facilitate players meeting other players: "Stan, we'd like you to Becky. She lives near you, is single, and always plays as Princess Peach in Mario Kart. Just like you!"
