I called my friend Brant to attend a screening of "<a href="http://www.everythingscool.org/home.htm" title="EverythingsCool.org">Everything's Cool</a>" at the SFIFF last weekend. It turns out that he was already there, as a panelist. That was only the first of many "Think Globally, Act&mdash;Hey I Know That Guy!" moments from the film.<!--more-->

Working in the communications department of an environmental non-profit, a film about the disinformation campaigns staged by energy companies about global warming probably wasn't going to contain a truckload of surprises for me. In fact, I cover such things <a href="http://www.sunshocked.com/stanifesto/archives/survival-bowl/" title="'Survival Bowl' on Stanifesto">all the time</a> on this blog. It did surprise me how the filmmakers managed to make a potentially bleak subject pretty funny (they describe it as a "toxic comedy") while leaving the issue its deserved respect.

Before the showing, writer/director Daniel Gold addressed the crowd. The film had began years ago and, after months and months of researching for a film about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/" title="But this one was made first...">whether or not global warming was real</a>, it became absolutely clear to everyone that what was really needed was a film about why there's still any doubt&mdash;they name it the "global warming gap", or the difference between what scientists know to be true and what the public thinks. Journalist <a href="http://www.heatisonline.org/main.cfm" title="The Heat is Online">Ross Gelbspan</a> puts it plainly in the film, "they've stolen our reality."

Ross is but one of many heroes and villains interviewed in the film, I couldn't help but think of him as the star. Years ago, he co-wrote an article about climate change and disease; skeptics immediately attacked it. His first reaction, as a journalist, was to <a href="http://www.evworld.com/archives/interviews/gelbspan1.html" title="An interview from '98">research their side of the argument</a>. Thinking the jury was still out in the scientific community, he backed off and even felt guilty. Later he discovered that these skeptics were all funded by the coal industry. He gets pissed and becomes determined to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. A decade later and Ross has retired because it's too damn depressing. He shrugs to the camera, admitting that article after article has made no dent and that&mdash;his daughter sitting not three feet from him on the couch&mdash;we're probably fucked. Another few years later and we see him pulled out of retirement by Katrina and traveling all over the nation speaking with high schools, colleges, the next generation. His is an irrepressible heroism.

The "next generation" is full of cameos of people I know. While climate crusader <a href="http://www.billmckibben.com/" title="Bill McKibben">Bill McKibben</a> inspires a crowd, we see <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/8742276/the_dropout/" title="I always make sure to refer to him as 'The Dropout' at Zeitgeist">Billy Parish</a> listening intently. Billy has done his fair share of <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/author/billy-parish/" title="I named this website, hee hee">inspiring others</a> as founder of the Climate Campaign and co-founder of Energy Action, the nation's largest youth climate coalition. Another next-genner can be seen as the dastardly Competitive Enterprise Institute counter-protests a climate action shouting, "Greenpeace kills! Greenpeace kills!" Campaigner <a href="http://ilovepostage.blogspot.com/2007/03/interview-dan-firger-wesleyan.html" title="An interview on I Love Postage">Dan Firger</a> smiles at the camera, "uhm, we're not even Greenpeace."

I had <a href="http://www.sunshocked.com/stanifesto/archives/what-i-was-missing/" title="'What I was missing' on Stanifesto">mentioned before</a> that I was worried that Nordhaus and Shellenberger, co-authors of "The Death of Environmentalism" didn't come off as heroes. I've only met Nordhaus in person but followed the whole debate from a few years ago quite closely (just google "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=death+of+environmentalism" title="Or click here">death of environmentalism</a>"). The film gets them just right: smart as hell, a tad reckless, and more than a tad completely full of themselves.

Unfortunately, mine was the last screening at SFIFF, but you can learn more, get involved, and pre-order the DVD on the <a href="http://www.everythingscool.org/action.htm" title="EverythingsCool.org">official website</a>. It's got more laughs than Inconvenient Truth, that's for sure.
