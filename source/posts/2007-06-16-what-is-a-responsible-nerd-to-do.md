Our nation is less than two weeks away from the arrival of the iPhone, but all is not well. Apple's exclusive partnership with AT&amp;T makes the iPhone a very difficult purchase to reconcile with nerd values.<!--more-->

Just last week, AT&amp;T was in the news for two major stories, revealing them as... I think the legal term is "dicks".

On Tuesday, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/06/att_spy_room_do.html" title="Threat Level at Wired.com"> classified documents were released</a> confirming that they did indeed help the NSA with their warrantless wire-tapping activities. They didn't just look the other way while the NSA did all the work but coordinated with them, re-routing traffic and purchasing equipment to make surveillance easier. The first of these "spy rooms" was <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=1103" title="ZDNet.com">constructed in San Francisco</a>, about four blocks from my office. To be clear, this is not stepping out of the way to let justice be served&mdash;the wiretaps are illegal&mdash;it's more like approaching a mugging in progress and offering the mugger a bigger gun.

Then on Wednesday, AT&amp;T announced plans to "filter content" over the internet. They've <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/06/att_to_police_i.html" title="More Threat Level at Wired.com">outlined a plan</a> where their servers will monitor the data packets sent through them and delete any that are found to by infringing on copyrights. They feel that somehow, by contributing to the infrastructure, they own what it carries. Imagine your water company deciding when you're allowed to have water or your power company deciding when you're allowed to have power. For even less of a stretch, imagine your telephone company (quite possibly AT&amp;T) deciding which phone calls you can make or receive. Consider further that something like "copyrighted content" is not uniformly illegal, as <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" title="Fair Use at Copyright.gov">legality depends on usage</a>, and you've got a real bull-in-a-china-shop situation (fitting because <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/06/wchina206.xml" title="'China's internet censorship' on Telegraph.co.uk">filtering internet content</a> is a criticism often aimed at the Chinese government).

Put these two together and you see an AT&amp;T that uses their power irresponsibly and, quite possibly, illegally. Not an ideal partner for Apple, whose been trying to keep their image clean. Yet when the iPhone comes out on June 29th, the only way to get it is along with a Cingular/AT&amp;T plan. What's a nerd to do? Here are a few possible solutions.

Steve's "blog" has recently had some fairly landmark posts on it about <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/" title="'Thoughts on Music' at Apple.com">Apple's perspective on DRM</a> and their <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/" title="'A Greener Apple' at Apple.com">environmental policies</a>, both of which have been in response to popular activist campaigns (the <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/" title="DefectiveByDesign.org">Free Software Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/" title="Green My Apple at Greenpeace.org">Greenpeace</a>, respectively). Perhaps they'd be willing to listen to reason on why telecommunications companies constantly monitoring our communications is not an ideal feature for "<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/" title="iLife at Apple.com">our digital life</a>".

The EFF (<a href="http://www.eff.org/" title="EFF.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>) continues to fight the bully telecoms in multiple arenas. Oh that's right, AT&amp;T is also starkly against Network Neutrality and even <a href="http://www.handsoff.org/" title="HandsOff.org">funds astroturf groups</a> to represent a non-existent public outcry in their favor. Almost forgot that. So the second possible solution is to set up a monthly donation to EFF equal to or exceeding your monthly donation (i.e. bill) to AT&amp;T.

The last option is to wait for the iPhone to become available on Verizon (only marginally better on the Net Neutrality front) or another service. This could happen after the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/wireless/2007-05-21-at&t-iphone_N.htm?csp=34" title="'At&amp;T eager to wield its iWeapon' at USAToday.com">exclusive partnership with AT&amp;T</a> is over (see, even Apple gets locked into lame 2-year contracts) or by someone <a href="http://www.everythingiphone.com/forum/iphone/iphone-unlock-672.html" title="The perils explained on EverythingiPhone.com">unlocking the iPhone</a> so it can be used with other carriers.

My current plan is to wait on the iPhone. Mostly this is because I've learned my lesson on buying 1st generation new product lines from Apple, having purchased one of the first G4s back in 2000 and one of the first MacbookPros last year. Both are phenomenal machines, with <a href="https://support.apple.com/macbookpro15/batteryexchange/" title="Apple's Battery Exchange Emporium">just a few kinks</a> that have since been worked out. But, unless I wait the full 5 years, this doesn't address the political aspects of avoiding AT&amp;T. Also to consider: does it make a damn difference? I've been boycotting Sony for almost ten years now and I don't think anyone but my mom even knows. Ultimately, I think it's a "can you look at yourself in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gallery/index5.html" title="The iPhone Gallery">mirror-like shiny Apple logo</a>?" issue. And that's a question we need to ask ourselves over more than just the phone we use.
