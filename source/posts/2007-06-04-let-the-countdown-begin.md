It will soon be the one year anniversary of the Stanifesto and I've decided to start celebrating early by tidying things up a bit. Reap the benefits of my <a href="http://www.psyche.com/psyche/qbl/comparative_numerology.html" title="Read and learn, heathen">numerological</a> neuroticism!<!--more-->

I've managed to write 86 posts so far since June 18th, the <a href="http://www.sunshocked.com/stanifesto/archives/the-televised-will-be-revolution-ed/" title="'The televised will be revolution-ed' on Stanifesto">first of the Stanifesto</a>. Some expert use of arithmetic will quickly reveal that the 18th is 14 days away and 86 is 14 shy of 100. You guessed it, I'm going to try and hit 100 before I hit 1. And that means <em>blogging every day</em> for the next two weeks.

Given that each Stanifesto post quite honestly takes a solid three hours including research, writing, editing, and making the thumbnails, that means that I'm promising 42 hours&mdash;almost two whole days&mdash;of work to you just to make the Stanifesto <a href="http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/birthday.asp" title="Goddamn copyrights">birthday party</a> a memorable one.

How can you help? I'm glad you asked. First, the Stanifesto currently has only 83 comments. That's less than one per post. Let's see if we can break 100 on comments as well. Anytime you see a post without a comment in the next two weeks, jump in and share your two cents. Even if it's to disagree with me or to suggest a more interesting topic (who knows, I might take your suggestion).

Blogging over the last year has changed me, but not in the way I had feared. I was worried about becoming one of those guys who never quite experiences life because he's too busy thinking about how to capture it for others. I've mostly resisted that and instead used this blog as an opportunity to go deeper into experiences that I've had, to think about them more critically and challenge my initial reactions, and to explain them when possible to people who might not communicate with me regularly.

Though I started with the theme "Communication &amp; Culture", I quickly realized that this was really too broad to be useful, as it <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/03/can_limitations.html" title="'Can limitations and restrictions be liberating?' at Presentation Zen">didn't really limit me</a> in any way, shape, or form. I mean, what doesn't fall into one of those two categories? A quick look at my tag cloud suggests that the themes that keep coming up here are: activism, design, internet, language, and politics. I'm comfortable with that dynamic and, honestly, more accurate description of the Stanifesto.

This is post 87. 13 to go.
