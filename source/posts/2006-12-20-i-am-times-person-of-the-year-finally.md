At 29, I've lived longer than Jimi Hedrix, James Dean, and Kurt Cobain. I had almost given up on celebrity, but then I go and get named Time Magazine's 2006 <i>Person of the Year</i>. All I can say, "It's about frickin' time."<!--more-->

I'm not lying or even embellishing. Feel free to check out Time Magazine's <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" title="Person of the Year 2006">official site</a> and see for yourself.

They cite many of my achievements over the last year. As Americans grew weary of the overproduced drivel on television they increasingly turned to sites like <a href="http://youtube.com/" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> for entertainment and I was there with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=stanleygjones" title="My YouTube page">my videos from Japan</a>. As Americans sought connection they looked for long lost friends and family on sites like <a href="http://myspace.com/" title="Behold, MySpace">MySpace</a> and I was there, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/stanley00" title="My space on MySpace">smiling back at them</a>.  As Americans rejected corporate news they turned to alternative sources, like <a href="http://www.technorati.com/" title="Technorati">blogs</a>, and I was there with the <a href="http://sunshocked.com/stanifesto/" title="This very site!">Stanifesto</a>. I haven't even mentioned the <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/47074" title="My Upcoming page">events I've added</a> to Upcoming or the <a href="http://del.icio.us/stanley00/" title="My del.icio.us page">links I've added</a> to Del.icio.us, but I think you get the idea.

I know what you're thinking. I wasn't even aware that Stan was a <em>candidate</em>! I know, right? Honestly, I was a little surprised myself... mostly because, if I qualify for these sorts of contests, why haven't I won any before?

This year, George Clooney was named People Magazine's <i>Sexiest Man Alive</i> <a href="http://www.people.com/people/package/sma2006/0,27542,,00.html" title="2006 Sexiest Man Alive">for a second time</a>. That's right, he was chosen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexiest_Man_Alive" title="Sexiest Man Alive on Wikipedia">back in 1997</a> as well. Granted, People does have a blog where you can <a href="http://guywatch.people.com/sma2006/#entry-14117653" title='GuyWatch' or something">nominate men you know personally</a> (how very 2.0 of them), but are our celebrity stocks so depleted we have to double-dip in the man candy already? That's like nominating someone with the last name of "Bush" or "Clinton" for president ever again&mdash;kind of a big "F-U" to the other 300 million or so Americans who haven't been tapped yet. Like me.

It's the same thing with that other big contest, the <a href="http://almaz.com/nobel/peace/peace.html" title="Some important people">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. They really need to take Time's lead and honor me with a golden dove or stick of dynamite or whatever you get when you win. I'm especially qualified as well. Take a look at the list of past winners. I've ordered substantially fewer people killed than either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger" title="Kissinger on Wikipedia">Henry Kissinger</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" title="Arafat on Wikipedia">Yasser Arafat</a>.

I'll be submitting my demo reel for Oscar consideration as soon as I have some time to burn a DVD.
