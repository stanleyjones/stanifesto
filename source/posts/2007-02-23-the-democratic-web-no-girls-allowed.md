Being a white, heterosexual male in the tech industry is not without its challenges. Some of the biggest revolve around how to make the tech industry less white, heterosexual, and male.<!--more-->

Maybe this issue hasn't quite hit mainstream news yet, but almost every blog I read is weighing in and I'll be <em>damned</em> if I don't use my position of privilege (by which I mean "a Mac user") to contribute on the subject as well.

The most recent uproar began when <a href="http://mikemonteiro.vox.com/library/post/the-future-of-white-apps.html" title="'The Future of White Apps' on Vox.com">Mike Monteiro</a> called out <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/" title="CarsonWorkshops">Carson Workshops</a> for it's ovewhlemingly white list of presenters. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/02/gender-diversity-at-web-conferences" title="'Gender Diversity at Web Conferences' on Kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a> poured gasoline on the fire, presenting gender percentages of various web conferences.

A backlash began from the event organizers. Eric Meyer heroically <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/02/23/diverse-it-gets/" title="'As diverse as it gets' on Meyerweb">blamed the system</a>, saying "Call that decision a manifestation of old-boy clubbiness if you want, but it isn't." He cites the research they did about who would attend an event with X, Y, Z speakers... lo and behold, the "A-List" was mostly men.

Trying to cite Micki Krimmel in this whole affair gives me a "circular reference" error, because back to back posts from Mickipedia <a href="http://www.mickipedia.com/?p=744" title="'Mike Monteiro is a ladies man' on Mickipedia">praise Monteiro</a> and <a href="http://www.mickipedia.com/?p=745" title="'Posers' on Mickipedia">critique the recent rise</a> of the word "poser" in tech circles. <a href="http://www.tinynibbles.com/violetblue.html" title="Violet Blue at TinyNibbles">Violet Blue</a> recently got called one, <a href="http://www.leahculver.com/2007/02/14/posers/" title="'Posers' on LeahCulver.com">Leah Culver</a> has come out in favor of the word, and Leah and Micki both shared spots on Violet's <a href="http://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2006/12/top_ten_sexiest_geeks_of_2006_1.html" title="'Top 10 Sexiest Geeks of 2006">Sexiest Geeks of 2006</a> list.

I bring up the poser discussion to illustrate the vastly different understandings of what an "expert" in this industry might be. Eric Meyer knows more about floating divs than I may ever, but his site is not nearly as nice looking as <a href="http://beccary.com/" title="Beccary">Becca Wei</a>'s, a top designer of WordPress themes (currently, two of the five "featured" themes are hers). Is he an expert because of the books he's had published? Because of the panels he's spoken on? How much of his success under these criteria are tied to his race, sexuality, or gender?

Before I jump in and tear anyone claiming that 0% of presenters at a conference being women is justified a new vagina (my first instinct), I should make sure my own house is in order. Of the blogs in my <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/" title="Newsfire = yummy">feedreader</a> with single authors (so not <a href="http://boingboing.net" title="BoingBoing">Boing Boing</a>, for instance), 41% are female. Yay, me. I am not a pig.

However, a closer look reveals most of the female blogs I subscribe to are people I know, not "experts" (though exceptionally talented writers, artists, designers, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smartacus/sets/72157594533042556/" title="Taxidermy valentine">otherwise crafty</a> people). I really have as far to go as everyone else.

This is really what it comes down to: who do we, as a community, hold up as our experts? Who's contributions do we say have value? While it's easy to say, "don't blame me for saying so, but this is the way the world works", I can only say, "don't blame me for saying so, but that puts you squarely in <em>part-of-the-problem</em> and not <em>part-of-the-solution</em>". How <em>should</em> the world work, and what can you/I/we do with the power we're afforded as white, heterosexual males to make it that way?

<small>Disclaimer: I bear Eric no ill-will; these are really tough, personal, and often emotionally-charged issues. His <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/02/24/diverse-reactions/" title="'Diverse Reactions' on MeyerWeb">follow-up post</a> acknowledges as much.</small>
