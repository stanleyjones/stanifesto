A dinner date last night turned unexpectedly into a discussion of how (or if) non-profits can be held accountable for their achievements to the same degree as for-profit ventures. I woke up wanting to do some more research and get a little deeper.<!--more-->

The basic situation is this: For-profit companies go away if they don't make money (their stated goal). Non-profit organizations can labor on indefinitely even if they don't make progress on fulfilling their mission statement (<em>their</em> stated goal).

There are lots of directions to go from here. First, a little clarification. While you'll frequently see for-profit companies running a loss (i.e. supported by venture capital until they become profitable) those companies do <em>eventually</em> disappear if the market doesn't support them. Consider Pets.com for an example (described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com" title="Pets.com on Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> as "a leading icon of the dot-com bubble"). Contrast this with the (at the time) scathing rebuke of non-profit successes from "<a href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/01/13/doe-intro/" title="A re-cap of the issue on Grist">Death of Environmentalism</a>".
<blockquote>Over the last 15 years environmental foundations and organizations have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into combating global warming. We have strikingly little to show for it.</blockquote>

Fifteen years of not running a profit is relatively unheard of in the for-profit world. After a few quarters, their shareholders are up-in-arms demanding more responsible management. This often means tightening business focus (often accompanied with <a href="http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/222586" title="'Doomed GM plant gets kudos for quality' at The Star">closing plants and laying off workers</a>), which gets to a fundamental difference between nons and fors. Closing offices and laying off non-profit workers does not help them achieve their mission, in fact it makes it harder. The equivalent in the non-profit world is to "liquidate" their mission, by making it less aggressive and thus easier to achieve. Ta-da, we're "profitable" again!

The question of "How can non-profits be more like for-profits?" comes up <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_45/b3907105_mz021.htm" title="'It's a how problem' at Businessweek">all the time</a> (and the various pros and cons are well-summarized by <a href="http://www.nten.org/blog/2007/05/23/nonprofit-management-vs-for-profit" title="NTEN.org">this article over at N-TEN</a>). Honestly, some afflictions <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Nonprofits-Fail-Overcoming-Fundphobia/dp/0787964093" title="'Why Non-Profits Fail' at Amazon">attributed solely to non-profits</a> (like "<a href="http://www.help4nonprofits.com/NP_Bd_FoundersSyndrome_Art.htm" title="Help4NonProfits.com">Founders Syndrome</a>") can be seen <a href="http://evhead.com/2006/10/birth-of-obvious-corp_25.asp" title="'The Birth of Obvious Corp.' at EvHead">in the for-profit world</a>, as well.

What doesn't get asked as often is, "How can for-profits be more like non-profits?" Namely, what if the mission of a company shifted from "Make money by producing Product X." to "Make the best Product X possible."? I'm not claiming that this <em>isn't</em> the goal of 90% of the employees of any company, but it's still not the stated goal. There are obviously financial considerations that make this an unapologetically idealistic and not realistic suggestion, but it's a worthy thought exercise. How would business practices change?

The specific discussion last night (and I should mention that the representatives for the <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter!">for-profit-but-not-evil</a> company and <a href="http://ran.org/" title="RAN.org">non-profit-but-often-frustrating</a> organization tended to agree on a lot) mostly circled around how <a href="http://nonprofit.about.com/b/a/196488.htm" title="Growth in Nonprofit World">non-profits keep growing</a> without a way to hold ineffective ones accountable. I would say that, like for-profits, non-profits are providing a product/service/utility that, if the public values, will get funded by donations. It might not be a thing you can hold in your hands (like a Coke can), it may just be a feeling that you're part of the solution&mdash;which many people value even more. This is the beauty behind <a href="http://socialedge.org/" title="SocialEdge.org">social entrepreneurship</a>.
